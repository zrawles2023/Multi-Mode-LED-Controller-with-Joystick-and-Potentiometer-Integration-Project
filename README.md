# Multi-Mode-LED-Controller-with-Joystick-and-Potentiometer-Integration-Project

Project Summary:
The project utilizes an Arduino Uno board along with a button, LEDs, a potentiometer, and a joystick. 
Its primary function is to control the state of LEDs connected to a breadboard, allowing them to be turned on or off and to blink. 
The project uses external libraries for handling button, joystick, and LED functionalities.


Key Components:
Arduino Uno board
Potentiometer
Joystick
Button (Joystick)
220 Ohm Resistors x6
LEDs x6
Jumper Wires x23


Key Features:
The LEDs are initially set to mode 1, representing the "on" state. Mode 2 represents the "blink" state.
The joystick is used to change the currently active LED by flicking it left or right.
The button is used to switch between mode 1 (on) and mode 2 (blink).
Potentiometer values are read to control the blinking speed of the LEDs.
LEDs can be turned off, on, or made to blink depending on the selected mode and potentiometer value.
